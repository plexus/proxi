module Proxi

  # Public: A bidirectional pipe between two sockets
  #
  # A Proxi::Socket takes an incoming request, and will initiate an outgoing
  # request, after which it forwards all traffic in both directions.
  #
  # Creating the outgoing request is delegated to a Proxi::SocketFactory. The
  # reason being that the type of socket can vary (TCPSocket, SSLSocket), or
  # there might be some logic involved to dispatch to the correct host, e.g.
  # based on the HTTP Host header (cfr. Proxi::HTTPHostSocketFactory).
  #
  # A socket factory can subscribe to events to make informed decision, e.g. to
  # inspect incoming data for HTTP headers.
  #
  # Proxi::Connection broadcasts the following events:
  #
  # - start_connection(Proxi::Connection)
  # - end_connection(Proxi::Connection)
  # - main_loop_error(Proxi::Connection, Exception)
  # - data_in(Proxi::Connection, Array)
  # - data_out(Proxi::Connection, Array)
